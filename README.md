Sonography, also known as ultrasound, is a safe and painless diagnostic imaging method that uses sound waves to create real-time images of internal organs, tissues, and blood flow. One of the biggest benefits is that it does not involve radiation, making it extremely safe even for pregnant women and babies. Doctors use sonography for multiple purposes, such as monitoring pregnancy, detecting gallstones, kidney diseases, thyroid conditions, and identifying tumors or cysts. It also helps guide certain medical procedures like biopsies with high precision. The real-time nature of ultrasound allows doctors to observe body functions and blood circulation instantly, which is critical for accurate treatment planning. Advanced sonography machines provide high-resolution imaging that ensures better diagnosis and minimizes errors. For expecting mothers, ultrasound brings reassurance by showing the development and health of the baby. In hospitals, skilled radiologists and sonographers work together to ensure accurate and reliable results. With its versatility, safety, and effectiveness, sonography remains an indispensable part of modern healthcare.
